    "- `DJIA_table.csv`: Downloaded directly from Yahoo Finance: check out the web page for more info.\n",
    "- `Combined_News_DJIA.csv`: Combined dataset (using the other two files) with 27 columns. The first column is \"Date\", the second is \"Label\", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from \"Top1\" to \"Top25\". The \"Label\" column can take only two values: \"1\" when \"DJIA Adj Close\" value rose or stayed as the same and \"0\" when \"DJIA Adj Close\" value decreased."
